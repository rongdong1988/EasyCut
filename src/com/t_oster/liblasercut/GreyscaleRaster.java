 * This class represents a defined Raster of greyscale pixels
 * which means it can be seen as 2 dimensional array of bytes.
 * 
 * It has a subset of the routines of the java.awt.BufferedImage
 * so this could easy be used with an adapter.
 * It was chosen to use this Interface rather than the BufferdImage
 * because there are some plattfroms (ie Android) where BufferedImage
 * is not available but other Image classes which can be used.
